VR Engineering Lab for Aerospace Engineering is an immersive virtual reality application designed to help students visualize, interact with, and perform aerospace engineering experiments in a simulated environment.
The project brings complex aerospace concepts to life through 3D models, interactive simulations, and real-time physics — making learning more intuitive, engaging, and accessible.

This VR lab can be used for:

Understanding aircraft and spacecraft components

Performing virtual wind-tunnel experiments

Exploring thrust, drag, lift, and aerodynamic flow

Observing rocket engine parameters (fuel flow rate, nozzle design, ISP, etc.)

Conducting hands-on practicals without physical lab constraints
